# SwatWorks Web Games

## Description
This project was created as part of a winter internship for a history professor at St. John's University during the winter of 2022-2023, as part of Swarthmore Colleges "SwatWorks" program. 

The project was designed to implement a set of educational game scripts designed by the professor. These games were played between 20 to 25 live students, but required tedious, manual calculations, so an online implementation was required to save time. 

For example, one game was created to simulate the Tragedy of the Commons, but required physical notes to be passed from each student to the professor to communicate their desired action. The professor would then have to gather, organize, and process the action each individual took. 

A real-time multiplayer web interface was created to solve this issue. The implementation allows the professor to monitor the current status of each player, easily process actions, and alter the rules of the game as they see fit.

## Reflection
Last Updated: October 2, 2023
Having now learned full-stack web development in a structured curriculum, I look back on this project as extremely beginner/amateur. There are no build tools like Vite or Webpack, and there are no npm packages installed/used. It is solely HTML, JavaScript, and a minimal amount of CSS, and the database updates are functional but executed client-side, and allow for potential data manipulation. There are also many bugs created by the structure of the code, but this can also be attributed to the lack of frameworks/libraries used.

However, the website is a functional multiplayer game that fully implements the provided game script. It includes authentication and a real-time database, and can be used in a live classroom. In the near future, I hope to rebuild the entire project using my updated knowledge to make it smoother, more structured, less buggy, and more visually appealing.
