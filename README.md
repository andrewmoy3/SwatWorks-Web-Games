# SwatWorks Web Games

# Under Construction
This is the rework of the SwatWorks-Web-Games Project using React and MongoDB

## Description

This project was created as part of a winter internship for a history professor at St. John's University during the winter of 2022-2023, as part of Swarthmore College's "SwatWorks" program.

The project was designed to implement a set of educational game scripts designed by the professor. These games were played between 20 to 25 live students, but required tedious, manual calculations, so an online implementation was required to save time.

For example, one game was created to simulate the Tragedy of the Commons, but required physical notes to be passed from each student to the professor to communicate their desired action. The professor would then have to gather, organize, and process the action each individual took.

A real-time multiplayer web interface was created to solve this issue. The implementation allows the professor to monitor the current status of each player, easily process actions, and alter the rules of the game as they see fit.
